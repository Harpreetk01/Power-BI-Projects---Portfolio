The objective of the project is to analyze the Udemy course data and extract 
insights based on the data.

## **Tool Used:-** 
Power BI.

## **Analysis:-**

### - **Summary Data Cards:**
💰 Average Course Price, 📚 Unique Courses, 👥 Total Subscribers, ⏱️ Average Course Duration

### - **Pie Charts - Course Distribution by Subject:**
🚀 Visual representation of the percentage distribution of courses across subjects.

### - **Stacked Bar Chart - Paid and Free Course Quantity:**
🚀 Illustrates the count of paid and free courses in each subject category.

### - **Matrix Chart - Subject-wise Analysis:**
🚀 Displays AVG price, total subscribers, and AVG content duration for the four subjects.

### - **Average Lectures per Subject - Clustered Column Chart:**
🚀 Utilizes a clustered column chart to compare the average number of lectures in each subject.

### - **Top 7 Subscribed and Reviewed Courses - Clustered Column and Bar Chart:**
🚀 Provides insights into the top 7 most subscribed and reviewed courses using a combination of clustered column and bar charts.

### - **Line Chart - Time Series Analysis**
I conducted a time series analysis to identify the annual trend in the number of published courses.

## **Insights:-**

**1.** From the analysis, we came to understand that the "maximum price" of courses is 200, and the average price of courses is 66. The total number of subscribers is 12 million. The total count of courses is 3700. The average hour of content duration is 3 to 4 hours.

**2.** Among the four major subjects, the most subscribed subject is web development, followed by finance, graphic design, and musical instruments. The average price of all four subjects lies between 50 and 80. And the average duration of all four subject courses is between 3 and 4 hours.

**3.** Among the 7 most subscribed courses, 6 are under the subject of Web Development, and one of the courses falls under the subject of Musical Instruments.

#### 📌**Supply Chain Analysis - Dashboard**

## **Objective:-**
The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from the data to optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

## **Analysis:-**
In Powe Bi, build charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize the data and understand it more interactively, along with that, build some slicers to make it more user-friendly to customize the charts and graphs.

Build some cards to understand some key performance indicators, including:

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):-**
1️⃣ Total Revenue: 577,000

2️⃣ Average Product Price: 49.46

3️⃣ Total Products Sold: 46,000

4️⃣ Manufacturing Cost: 47.27

5️⃣ Total Available Products: 4,840

6️⃣ Total Stock Value: 4,777

### **Charts and Graphs:**

1. Average Defect Rate, Manufacturing Lead Time, and Manufacturing Cost by Product
2. Customer Demographics vs. Number of Products Sold by Product Type
3. Total Revenue Generated by Product Type and Total Products Sold by Product Type
4. Average Manufacturing Cost vs. Average Price by Product Type
5. Transportation Modes vs. Routes with Average Cost
6. Defect Rate vs. Inspection Rate by Product Type
7. Transportation Modes and Shipping Carriers with Average Shipping Time

### **Build Interactive Slicers of - Columns:**
