#### 📌**Car Insurance Claim Analysis - Dashboard**

## **Objective:-**
The project's objective is to analyze the car insurance data and extract insights based on the data.

Analyze the data to extract key information such as average claim frequency, average claim amount, car model, customer loyalty claim percentage, and impact of household income.

In this project, I categorize my analysis into five sections:

1️⃣ Claim Frequency by Demographics

3️⃣ Coverage Zone
4️⃣ Customer Loyalty
5️⃣ Impact of Household Income

And eventually, I extracted some key insights from the data.

## **Insights:-**

1. Based on car model risk profiles, adjust insurance premiums.
2. Launch targeted education programs on safe driving to reduce accidents and insurance programs for low-education policyholders.
3. Married and Single individuals have the highest claim frequency, so offer specialized policies that address their needs, such as family coverage or discounts for multiple vehicles.
4. Offer some benefits and incentives to policyholders for maintaining a clean claims record.
